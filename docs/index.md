This course covers the fundamentals of machine learning, its applications to geoscientific problems, and
it provides basic best practices for the rigorous development and evaluation of machine learning models.
The main focus of the course is on describing the fundamental theory of *linear regression*, *logistic regression*,
*neural networks*, *convolutional neural networks*, *sequence modelling*, *dimensionality reduction*, 
*generative modelling*, and *physics-inspired neural networks*. Students will also be introduced to 
practical applications in geoscience for each of the presented methods; lab sessions will be held using the PyTorch
computational framework in the Python programming language.
